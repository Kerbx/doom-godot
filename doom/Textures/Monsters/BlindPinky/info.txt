This deformed pinky demon has adapted to living in areas of complete darkness. Unlike its cousin it
has no eyes or horns. While this may seem like it would make for a less threatening creature, that's
far from the truth. With lack of vision it has extremely good hearing and will use its superior
speed to quickly attack its prey before they can escape. Additionally, it has sharper teeth which
gives more ripping power. They wander around aimlessly but as long as you stay quite you should be
safe... shh.
